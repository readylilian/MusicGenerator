# MusicGenerator
**Goals In Order of Importance:**
- Be able to import a file, read it into notes that can then be processed
- Import many files, each stored as a different song
- Process the imported songs, create a new song based on what it has learned from the imported songs

**Secondary goals:**
- Upload the new song to spotify as a local file, assess the info for the new song (energy, if it picks up vocals etc)
- Compare to the analysis of the songs originally, if the created song falls within range of the original songs it's a success
